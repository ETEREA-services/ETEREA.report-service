fix(ci): revert to client-side mermaid rendering

Reverts the documentation pipeline to use client-side rendering for Mermaid diagrams. This change is necessary to avoid sandbox errors in the GitHub Actions environment that prevent `mermaid-cli` from running.

- Removes the `npm install` and `mmdc` steps from `generate-docs.yml`.
- Updates the `index.html` to include `mermaid.js` and render diagrams dynamically.
